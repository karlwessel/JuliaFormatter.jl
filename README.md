Width-sensitive formatter for Julia code. Inspired by gofmt and refmt.

```julia
]add https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl
```

`JuliaFormatter` exports `format_text`, `format_file` and `format`:

```julia
format_text(text::AbstractString; indent = 4, margin = 92)
format_file(file::AbstractString; indent = 4, margin = 92, overwrite = true)
format(paths...; indent = 4, margin = 92, overwrite = true)
```

The `text` argument to `format_text` is a string containing the code to be formatted; the formatted code is returned as a new string. The `file` argument to `format_file` is the path of a file to be formatted. The `format` function is either called with a single string to format if it is a `.jl` file or to recurse into looking for `.jl` files if it is a directory. It can also be called with a collection of such paths to iterate over.

*Options:*

* `indent` - the number of spaces used for an indentation.
* `margin` - the maximum number of characters of code on a single line. Lines over
the limit will be wrapped if possible. There are cases where lines cannot be wrapped
and they will still end up wider than the requested margin.
* `overwrite` - if the file should be overwritten by the formatted output. If set to false, the formatted version of file named `foo.jl` will be written to `foo_fmt.jl`.

There is also a command-line tool `bin/format.jl` which can be invoked with `-i`/`--indent` and `-m`/`--margin` and with paths which will be passed to `format`.


## How It Works

`JuliaFormatter` parses the `.jl` source file into a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) using [`CSTParser`](https://github.com/ZacLN/CSTParser.jl).

### Pass 1: Prettify

The CST is "prettified", creating a `PTree`. The printing output of a `PTree` is a canonical representation of the code removing unnecessary whitespace and joining or separating lines of code. The [`pretty` testset](./test/runtests.jl) displays these transformations.

Example:

```julia
function  foo
end

->

function foo end
```

### Pass 2: Nesting

In the nesting phase lines going over the print width are split into multiple lines such that they fit within
the allowed width. All expressions are nested front to back with the exception of binary operations and conditionals.

Examples:


```julia
arg1 + arg2

->

arg1 + 
arg2
```

```julia
foo() = body

->

# The indentation of the body is based on `indent_size`
foo() =
    body
```

**Conditionals**

```julia
cond ? e1 : e2

->

cond ? e1 :
e2

->

cond ? 
e1 :
e2
```

**Calls** (also applies to {}, (), [], etc)

```julia
f(arg1, arg2, arg3)

->

f(
  arg1,
  arg2,
  arg3
)
```

```julia
function longfunctionname_that_is_long(lots, of, args, even, more, args)
    body
end

->

function longfunctionname_that_is_long(
    lots, 
    of, 
    args,
    even, 
    more, 
    args
)
    body
end
```

```julia
S <: Union{Type1,Type2,Type3}

->

S <: Union{
   Type1,
   Type2,
   Type3
}
```

### Part 3: Printing

Finally, the `PTree` is printed to an `IOBuffer`. Prior to returning the formatted text a final validity
check is performed.

## Skipping Files

If you wish to not format a file this can be done by writing "nofmt" in a comment on the first line
of the file. Suppose this is the content of `foo.jl`:

```julia
# nofmt

module Foo
...
end
```

`JuliaFormatter` will see the comment on the first line, notice it contains "nofmt", and return the original text.

## Present Limitation(s)

Inline comments inside of a nestable types are removed.

Example:

```julia
function foo(
    a, # a does ...
    b, # b does ...
    c
)
    body
end
```

When formatted will produce:

```julia
function foo(
    a,
    b,
    c
)
    body
end
```
